# README: Data Visualization of Bird Strikes (2000 â€“ 2011)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the visualization of bird strike data collected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from 2000 to 2011. A bird strike refers to a collision between a bird and an aircraft, posing a significant threat to aviation safety. This project aims to provide insights into bird strike incidents through various visualizations and analyses, identifying patterns, phases of flight during strikes, altitudes, affected airlines, and airports with the highest occurrences. The goal is to enhance safety measures by understanding these incidents better.

## Technology and Tools
The project utilizes data science techniques for visual representation. You can use tools such as Python, Tableau, Power BI, or other platforms that facilitate data analysis and visualization. The dataset is publicly available, and the approach is designed to be flexible, allowing for different analytical methods and tools depending on your preference.

## Project Requirements and Deliverables
To complete this project, the code must be modular, maintainable, testable, and portable across different environments. The final deliverables include a Tableau Public link or a PDF of your Python code, along with a detailed project report summarizing the findings and visualizations. Additionally, a demo link and case study visualizations should be included to provide a comprehensive view of the bird strike analysis.
