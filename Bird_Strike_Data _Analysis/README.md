# README: Data Visualization of Bird Strikes (2000 â€“ 2011)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the visualization of bird strike data collected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from 2000 to 2011. A bird strike refers to a collision between a bird and an aircraft, posing a significant threat to aviation safety. This project aims to provide insights into bird strike incidents through various visualizations and analyses, identifying patterns, phases of flight during strikes, altitudes, affected airlines, and airports with the highest occurrences. The goal is to enhance safety measures by understanding these incidents better.

## Technology and Tools
The project utilizes data science techniques for visual representation.Tools such as Python, Power BI are used for data analysis and visualization. The dataset is publicly available.
